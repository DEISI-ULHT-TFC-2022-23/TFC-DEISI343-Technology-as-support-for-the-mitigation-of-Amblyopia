## IMPORTANT
The Unity project became corrupt at some point, as far as the students understood, due to a conflict between OneDrive local sync and git usage.
The project was recovered (scenes were exported and imported to a new Unity project via Unity packages.

The main outcome of this process was the initialization of the GitHub repo (the new project was pushed using the "--force" argument clearing commit history.

Some of these commits, no longer accessible from the GitHub project page, are still accessible from the Jira project page, whenever the commit was linked to a Jira ticket.
